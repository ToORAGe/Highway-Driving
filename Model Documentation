Project details


1) The code implemented herein is based on the spline concept demonstrated in the Q&A video. 
2) Finite states named  a) too close 
			b) prepare_lane
          		c) prepare_for_left 
          		d) prepare_for_right
          		e) lane_change 
          		f) extremely_close

	are used for path planning. 
3) too_close tells us if the car in front of the ego vehicle is too close (within a distance of 30m). If this flag is activated the ref_vel (reference velocity) variable is 
decremented by 0.224m/s (deceleration) 
4) "prepare_lane" tells if the vehicle needs to change lane since the car in front of the current lane is too slow or too close. 
5) "prepare_for_left" flag tells us if the left lane of the ego vehicle is free for lane change. A margin of 15m has been used in case of lane change i.e., if there are no 
vehicles in the left lane within 15m in front or behind the furture porition of the ego vehicle, the ego vehicle can prepare to change lanes (either left or right 
based on other vehicles)
6) "prepare_for_right" flag tells us that the right lane of the current lane is free. 
7) Preference is given to left lane in case both the left and right lanes of the current lane are free and the "prepare_lane" flag is activated. 
8) The "lane_change" flag tells if either of the flags "prepare_for_left" or "prepare_for_right" is activated. 
9) The "extremely_close" flag tells us if the vehicle in front is extremely close to the ego vehicle and within a margin of 15m. If this flag is activated(set to "true"),
the deceleration is set to 0.5 m/s^2. (almost twice the normal deceleration), to avoid collision with vehicles. 
10) 30 points have been used for the future path of the vehicle to avoid collisions as for some scenarios during testing, the vehicle ahead of the ego vehicle 
suddenly changed lanes and resulted in collision. It was also observed that only 3 points are being used at each iteration i.e., each previous_path length was 30-3 = 27. 
11) If none of the flags is activated and if the velocity of the car is below the speed limit fo 50 mph, the reference velocity is incremented (acceleration) by 0.224 m/s^2.
